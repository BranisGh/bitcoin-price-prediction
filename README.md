## Predicting the Value of Bitcoin using Machine Learning Algorithms
### 1. Introduction
Bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency that has gained a lot of attention in recent years. The value of Bitcoin is highly volatile and can change rapidly. In this project, we aim to predict the value of Bitcoin using machine learning algorithms.
### 2. Motivation and Novelties
The motivation behind this project is to help investors make informed decisions about buying or selling Bitcoin. By predicting the value of Bitcoin, investors can make better decisions about when to buy or sell Bitcoin. The novelty of this project is the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the value of Bitcoin.
### 3. Contributions
The contributions of this project are twofold. First, we will develop a machine learning model that can predict the value of Bitcoin with high accuracy. Second, we will provide insights into the factors that affect the value of Bitcoin.
